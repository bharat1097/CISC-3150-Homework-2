Question 4 (Updated):

int x = 4282;
for(int i=0;i<35;i++){
	System.out.printf("%d\t\t%32s\n",i,Integer.toBinaryString(x>>>i);
}

VS

int x = 4282;
for(int i=0;i<35;i++){
	System.out.printf("%d\t\t%32s\n",i,Integer.toBinaryString(x));
	x = x >>> i;
}


I think that the reason for getting different outputs for these seemingly equivalent pieces of code is because if you notice in the first code,
the value of variable 'x' is NOT changing. It remains the same throughout the course of the for-loop. But in the second code the statement,
x = x>>>i; causes the value of 'x' to be different for each iteration of the for-loop.
